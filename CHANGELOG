* 0.0.0.7 *

* Fixed a bug which could cause applications to fail in production (after running
  `rake jax:package`). It was due to the packager adding helper files in the wrong
  order.



* 0.0.0.6 *

* Introduced Jax.uptime, a running total of number of seconds since the Jax subsystem
  was _loaded_ (not necessarily instantiated). This is now used in place of various
  timers in Jax, e.g. for calculating the +timechange+ argument to #update methods.

* Added 'picking' support via Jax.World#pick(x,y); Jax.World#pickIndex(x,y);
  Jax.World#pickRegion(x1,y1, x2,y2); Jax.World#pickRegionalIndices(x1,y1, x2,y2).
  This is the last milestone prior to v1.0 release.

* Lots of new JavaScript API documentation

* Renamed Jax.Camera#getModelViewMatrix() to Jax.Camera#getTransformationMatrix().
  The latter is more accurate. THIS WILL BREAK EXISTING APPS but since Jax is still
  considered pre-release I'm not taking the extra step to deprecate it.

* Added Jax version number and framerate counter to spec layouts

* Added perlin noise example to /spec/example_app

* Added aliases for Math.radToDeg / Math.rad2deg and Math.degToRad / Math.deg2rad



* 0.0.0.5 *

* Jax now checks JS version against gem version and reports on mismatches

* Perlin noise functions added -- just do this in your shader:
  //= require "functions/noise"

* Split 'paraboloid-depthmap' shader into 2 separate shaders: 'paraboloid' and 'depthmap'
  This makes it possible to reuse paraboloids for environment mapping.

* Shader dependencies are now loaded via Jax.shader_load_paths, which can be multiple
  different directories (e.g. Jax builtin + app/shaders) This makes functions used by
  Jax available for reuse in custom shaders.

* Added CHANGELOG. :)
