* 0.0.0.5 *

* Jax now checks JS version against gem version and reports on mismatches

* Perlin noise functions added -- just do this in your shader:
  //= require "functions/noise"

* Split 'paraboloid-depthmap' shader into 2 separate shaders: 'paraboloid' and 'depthmap'
  This makes it possible to reuse paraboloids for environment mapping.

* Shader dependencies are now loaded via Jax.shader_load_paths, which can be multiple
  different directories (e.g. Jax builtin + app/shaders)

* Added CHANGELOG. :)
