ActiveRecord models should act in place of Jax resource files. Jax should produce an additional file for each
ActiveRecord model generated:

  app/assets/javascripts/jax/resources/main_menus.js.erb

The file by default would look like:

  <%# By default, all Main Menus will be loaded into Jax %>
  <% MainMenu.all.each do |main_menu| %>
    MainMenu.addResource(<%= main_menu.to_json %>);
  <% end %>

##

Jax plugins should live in vendor/jax/plugins/ instead of just vendor/plugins/:

##

The `jax package` command should simply puke out a message instructing the user to run Rails' `rake assets:precompile`
command instead.

Note: Jax may need to add the built-in shaders and jax.js to +config.assets.precompile+:

  config.assets.precompile += [ 'jax.js', 'builtin/app/shaders/**/*.js' ]
